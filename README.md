# CNN-Applications-in-Skin-Disease-Prediction-and-Detection-

Abstract— Skin cancer remains one of the most 
prevalent and deadly forms of cancer globally, 
necessitating advancements in early detection and 
accurate diagnosis to improve patient outcomes. This 
report explores the application of Convolutional 
Neural Networks (CNNs) for skin disease prediction 
and detection, utilizing the HAM10000 dataset—a 
comprehensive collection of dermatoscopic images 
of various skin lesions. Our research aims to develop 
a sophisticated model that enhances identifying 
potentially malignant conditions through deep 
learning techniques. We use ResNet-50, VGG16, 
and Inception-ResNet-V2 architectures to use data 
augmentation techniques to rectify class imbalances 
and enhance model resilience. Every model is 
painstakingly adjusted and assessed for efficiency 
and classification accuracy; the results show 87% 
accuracy across various architectures. This study 
underscores the transformative potential of CNNs in 
dermatology, paving the way for automated 
diagnostic tools that can assist healthcare 
professionals in making informed decisions, 
ultimately leading to improved patient care in the 
fight against skin cancer.

 demonstrated great potential in recent years for 
improving and automating the categorization of skin 
lesions. This research aims to use the HAM10000 
dataset to create a sophisticated skin cancer detection 
model by utilizing CNNs. By harnessing the power 
of deep learning, we aim to create a robust tool that 
can assist dermatologists in identifying potentially 
malignant skin conditions early. The significance of 
this project lies in its potential to improve early 
detection rates, streamline diagnostic processes, and 
ultimately contribute to better patient outcomes in the 
fight against skin cancer.
