# Abstract

Skin cancer remains one of the most prevalent and deadly forms of cancer globally, necessitating advancements in early detection and accurate diagnosis to improve patient outcomes. This report explores the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for skin disease prediction and detection, utilizing the HAM10000 datasetâ€”a comprehensive collection of dermatoscopic images of various skin lesions. Our research aims to develop a sophisticated model that enhances identifying potentially malignant conditions through deep learning techniques. We use ResNet-50, VGG16, and Inception-ResNet-V2 architectures to use data augmentation techniques to rectify class imbalances and enhance model resilience. Every model is painstakingly adjusted and assessed for efficiency and classification accuracy; the results show 87% accuracy across various architectures. This study underscores the transformative potential of CNNs in dermatology, paving the way for automated diagnostic tools that can assist healthcare professionals in making informed decisions, ultimately leading to improved patient care in the fight against skin cancer. 

Keywords: Skin Cancer, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Deep Learning, HAM10000 Dataset, Transfer Learning and Medical Imaging.
